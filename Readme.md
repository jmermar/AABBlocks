# AABBlocks

This project is intended to become yet another minecraft clone in Vulkan, centered in a minimal functionality and finite persistent worlds.

I created this project with the idea of testing multple rendering techniques such as SSR, deferred rendering and GPU based occlusion and frustum culling. Right now the project is barebones and dont have
any of these.

# Build

Despite having been built on CMake and having all it's dependencies explicity included, I have not tested yet in other than my Ubuntu device. Given that I'm not giving any information on how to built it right now.
